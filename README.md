## How I became a developer (short version)

- Started in **support & finance**, automating my work with **Excel + VBA macros**.
- Saw a painful problem: tons of telemetry bundles, no tool to analyse them.
- Built a scrappy PHP app that processed thousands of bundles for hundreds of engineers.
- That project put me on the map: I was pulled into automation work and finally became a full-time developer.

No CS degree — just JIT learning, persistence, and a lot of increasingly complex projects building up real-world experience. 💡

Now I help others escape tutorial hell, ship things, and build careers around it. 🚀

---

## What I love helping people with

- Escaping tutorial paralysis and designing a **project roadmap**
- Writing clean, tested, idiomatic Python – and sharing what I’m learning as I dive deeper into Rust and other languages
- Building CLIs, web apps, and automations that actually get used
- Levelling up from “coder” to **trusted engineer / senior dev**
- Creating systems for consistent learning: exercises, reading, and reflection
- Turning your editor (especially **Vim**) and terminal into real productivity multipliers –

    10 years of teaching Python. Thousands of exercises completed. 

And then we built a Rust platform. 

Here's why. (28 Feb 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mfwcvdxpwq2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>

    Is reading books declining? 🤔

Common sentiments: 
• Where did my time go today? 
• I've just spent (wasted) an hour watching short videos. 
• I can never seem to find time to get a deep read in, it's all quick and shallow these days :/ (27 Feb 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mftjkvzyds23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>

  <li>
    Python dev feedback learning Rust: "I understand Python better now."

Say again?

Here's why that happens.

Python lets you do this:

data = [1, 2, 3]
process_a(data)
process_b(data)
print(data)  # What's in here? Depends on what process_a and process_b did. (27 Feb 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mft6izike32y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>
