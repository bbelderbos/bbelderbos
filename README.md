## How I became a developer (short version)

- Started in **support & finance**, automating my work with **Excel + VBA macros**.
- Saw a painful problem: tons of telemetry bundles, no tool to analyse them.
- Built a scrappy PHP app that processed thousands of bundles for hundreds of engineers.
- That project put me on the map: I was pulled into automation work and finally became a full-time developer.

No CS degree — just JIT learning, persistence, and a lot of increasingly complex projects building up real-world experience. 💡

Now I help others escape tutorial hell, ship things, and build careers around it. 🚀

---

## What I love helping people with

- Escaping tutorial paralysis and designing a **project roadmap**
- Writing clean, tested, idiomatic Python – and sharing what I’m learning as I dive deeper into Rust and other languages
- Building CLIs, web apps, and automations that actually get used
- Levelling up from “coder” to **trusted engineer / senior dev**
- Creating systems for consistent learning: exercises, reading, and reflection
- Turning your editor (especially **Vim**) and terminal into real productivity multipliers –

    Confidence comes from Shipping

There is no better feeling than `git push` -> `Deployed`. 🚀

Last week, one of our PDC Foundations students went from "I've never packaged an app" to having their CLI tool installable via `pip` - we love seeing these lightbulb moments. 💡 (26 Jan 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mdcrr6grf52p" target="_blank">link</a>

The real power of LLMs unlocks when you give them typed tools.
In Python, we can define a function and expose it to the model using Pydantic schemas. (25 Jan 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mdbjf6n7zn2j" target="_blank">link</a>

    Custom Django template filters for cleaner templates: Stop cluttering templates with logic. Write a simple filter, register it, and your templates stay readable. ... (26 Jan 2026) - <a href="https://github.com/bbelderbos/bobcodesit/blob/main/notes/20260126094004.md" target="_blank">link</a>

  <li>
    Prompt engineering patterns: config as data: Don't hardcode AI prompts and channel rules in your code. Store them as data structures so they're easy to tweak and extend. ...

  <li>
    Model properties for computed state in Django: Instead of scattering state checks across views and templates, put them on the model as `@property` methods. Self-documenting and DRY. ...
