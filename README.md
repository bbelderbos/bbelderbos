## How I became a developer (short version)

- Started in **support & finance**, automating my work with **Excel + VBA macros**.
- Saw a painful problem: tons of telemetry bundles, no tool to analyse them.
- Built a scrappy PHP app that processed thousands of bundles for hundreds of engineers.
- That project put me on the map: I was pulled into automation work and finally became a full-time developer.

No CS degree — just JIT learning, persistence, and a lot of increasingly complex projects building up real-world experience. 💡

Now I help others escape tutorial hell, ship things, and build careers around it. 🚀

---

## What I love helping people with

- Escaping tutorial paralysis and designing a **project roadmap**
- Writing clean, tested, idiomatic Python – and sharing what I’m learning as I dive deeper into Rust and other languages
- Building CLIs, web apps, and automations that actually get used
- Levelling up from “coder” to **trusted engineer / senior dev**
- Creating systems for consistent learning: exercises, reading, and reflection
- Turning your editor (especially **Vim**) and terminal into real productivity multipliers –

    🎙️ New podcast: Building reactive Python notebooks with #Marimo 💪🚀

Have you tried Marimo yet? 

It fixes a lot of classic Jupyter pains: hidden state, brittle execution order, and notebooks that are hard to reuse. (21 Nov 2025) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3m65kcvadfu27" target="_blank">link</a>

    I love `all()` but sometimes a set operation is more succinct in #Python 

Here `issubset` reads as: 

"Are all required checks contained in what’s done?" (20 Nov 2025) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3m62mgurxjh2k" target="_blank">link</a>

  <li>
    From explicit to declarative / expressive #Python

Had a super cool ensemble coding session today solving the “Analyze stock data” Bite. 🚀

It was a great reminder of how far you can refactor a function by leaning on built-ins 🐍

Here’s how our final function evolved: (19 Nov 2025) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3m5ynxg522b2t" target="_blank">link</a>

    from messy to clean numbers with `removeprefix` / `removesuffix`: With `removeprefix("$")` and `removesuffix(suffix)` you strip only what you *expect* to be there, then `float(cap) * multiplier` does the rest. Classic EAFP: try to parse, fall back to `0.0` when the data is junk. ... (20 Nov 2025) - <a href="https://github.com/bbelderbos/bobcodesit/blob/main/notes/20251120071001.md" target="_blank">link</a>
