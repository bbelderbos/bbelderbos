## How I became a developer (short version)

- Started in **support & finance**, automating my work with **Excel + VBA macros**.
- Saw a painful problem: tons of telemetry bundles, no tool to analyse them.
- Built a scrappy PHP app that processed thousands of bundles for hundreds of engineers.
- That project put me on the map: I was pulled into automation work and finally became a full-time developer.

No CS degree — just JIT learning, persistence, and a lot of increasingly complex projects building up real-world experience. 💡

Now I help others escape tutorial hell, ship things, and build careers around it. 🚀

---

## What I love helping people with

- Escaping tutorial paralysis and designing a **project roadmap**
- Writing clean, tested, idiomatic Python – and sharing what I’m learning as I dive deeper into Rust and other languages
- Building CLIs, web apps, and automations that actually get used
- Levelling up from “coder” to **trusted engineer / senior dev**
- Creating systems for consistent learning: exercises, reading, and reflection
- Turning your editor (especially **Vim**) and terminal into real productivity multipliers –

    "Rust is too hard."

I hear this constantly from Python developers. The borrow checker. Lifetimes. Ownership. It sounds intimidating.

Here's the truth: Rust is different, not harder. (08 Feb 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3mee75orfdt2t" target="_blank">link</a>

    TIL that #GitHub renders Mermaid diagrams natively in markdown files. Just use a fenced code block with `mermaid` as the language. 🚀

Works in READMEs, issues, PRs, and wikis. 
No external tools needed, the diagram lives in your md, version-controlled with your code. 😍 (05 Feb 2026) - <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bbelderbos.bsky.social/post/3me4gmvnxo32q" target="_blank">link</a>
